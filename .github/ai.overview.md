## üìä Actual Implementation Progress

### Reality Check

```text
Project Status:          Design Complete / No Implementation
Code Implementation:     0% (Only empty files exist)
GUI Development:         0% (No GUI code written)
Core Functionality:      0% (No working features)
Testing:                 0% (No code to test)
Documentation:           95% (Design and guidelines complete)
```

### What Actually Works Right Now

1. **venv.bat** - Can create and activate Python virtual environment           |
2. **Documentation** - Comprehensive design and development guidelines         |
3. **Project Structure** - Basic folder organization for future development    |
4. **Version Control** - Git repository with proper structure                  |

### What Does NOT Work Right Now

1. **Everything Else** - No functional code has been written yet               |
2. **No GUI** - Cannot launch any windows or interfaces                       |
3. **No Tracking** - No coordinate tracking or window detection               |
4. **No Screenshots** - No capture or analysis capabilities                   |
5. **No Hotkeys** - No global hotkey functionality                           |

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps for Implementation

### Before Any Coding

1. **Environment Setup** - Run venv.bat and install required Python packages  |
2. **Dependency Installation** - pip install PyQt6, pillow, pywin32, pynput   |
3. **Development Environment** - Set up IDE and debugging tools               |

### First Implementation Priority

1. **Basic Launcher** - Create minimal working Python application              |
2. **Simple GUI Window** - Basic tkinter or PyQt6 window that opens           |
3. **Mouse Position Display** - Basic coordinate tracking and display          |
4. **Exit Functionality** - Proper application shutdown and cleanup           |

## üîç Current Technical Debt

### Known Issues

- **No Implementation** - Everything exists only in design documents           |
- **Empty Code Files** - launcher.py and other files are completely empty     |
- **No Dependencies** - Required Python packages not yet installed            |
- **No Testing** - No test framework or test cases exist                      |
- **No Error Handling** - No code means no error handling                     |

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk** - Project is 100% design with 0% implementation               |
- **Dependency Risk** - Required libraries not yet tested or validated        |
- **Complexity Risk** - Ambitious design may be challenging to implement      |
- **Timeline Risk** - No functioning prototype to validate design decisions   |

## üìù Documentation vs Reality

### What Documentation Claims vs What Exists

| LYX Innovations       | 100%       | 0%                  | -100%  |
| Performance Metrics   | 100%       | 0%                  | -100%  |

### Honest Assessment

The project has excellent, comprehensive design documentation but zero          |
functional implementation. This is normal for early-stage projects but        |
important to acknowledge honestly for planning and expectations.               |
